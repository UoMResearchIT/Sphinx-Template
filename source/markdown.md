A very simple markdown document
===============================

Just a small example to show that Sphinx can now be used with markdown and not only restructuredText. There are still some limitations (mathjax does not work with markdown) but it is functional.

More information can be found: http://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_structify.html


``` important:: Markdown accept different kind of header. The most classical one with the # in front does not seems to work. Use the present alternative (underline style)
```
